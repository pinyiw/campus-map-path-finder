# Create a graph
created graph g

# Add nodes
added node a to g
added node b to g
added node c to g

# Add edges
added edge e1 from a to b in g
added edge e2 from b to a in g
added edge e3 from a to c in g
added edge e4 from c to a in g
added edge e5 from b to c in g
added edge e6 from c to b in g

# Print the outgoing edges from a, b and c
the children of a in g are: b(e1) c(e3)
the children of b in g are: a(e2) c(e5)
the children of c in g are: a(e4) b(e6)
