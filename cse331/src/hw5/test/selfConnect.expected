# Create a graph
created graph g

# Add nodes
added node a to g
added node b to g
added node c to g

# Add edges
added edge e1 from a to a in g
added edge e2 from b to b in g
added edge e3 from c to c in g

#Print the outgoing edges from a, b and c
the children of a in g are: a(e1)
the children of b in g are: b(e2)
the children of c in g are: c(e3)
