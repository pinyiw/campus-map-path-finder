Problem 6.

(a) Because the condition of getFibTerm to throw IllegalArgumentException is wrong.
	It should be n < 0 instead of n <= 0.

(b) Since the condition of getFibTerm to throw IllegalArgumentException was n <= 0,
	getFibTerm(0) will throw exception. I fixed this bug when dealing with the
	failure of testThrowsIllegalArgumentException.
	
(c)	It fails because Fibonacci sequence should be adding instead of subtracting,
	and n == 2 should not be a base case.
	I fixed it by changing the condition of base case and adding the return value
	of recursive calls instead of subtracting.

Problem 7. 

a. Warm-Up: Creating a Ball: Ball.java
	Fixed a bug in constructor, assigning the parameter volume to this.volume
	In getVolume(), return this.volume instead of 0.
	
b. Using Pre-Defined Data Structures: BallContainer.java
	The second approaches of implementing getVolume() is better, since keeping
	track of the total volume every time it add or remove a ball only cause constant
	time slower than not keeping track of it for add() and remove(). Also, for the
	first approaches the runtime for getVolume() is O(n), while for the second 
	approaches it would be O(1).
c 1.The first way I would implement getBallsFromSmallest() is make a new list field
	that store all the Ball when ever it is added to or remove from the Box and sort
	and return the iterator of the list when getBallsFromSmallest() is called.
	Another way to implement getBallsFromSmallest() is when ever the Ball is added to
	the Box, sorted it right away, in this case, we would just return the iterator of
	the list whenever getBallsFromSmallest() is called, since the list is already
	sorted.
  2.I would say it depends on how often the add method and getBallsFromSmallest is
  	called. If we know client will add Ball to Box much more often than
  	getBallsFromSmallest, then the first way is better, since we won't have to sort the
  	list a lot of time.
  	On the other hand, if we know that client will not call a lot of add and will call
  	getBallFromSmallest very often, the second way will be better.
