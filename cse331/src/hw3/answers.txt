Problem 6.

(a) Because the condition of getFibTerm to throw IllegalArgumentException is wrong.
	It should be n < 0 instead of n <= 0.

(b) Since the condition of getFibTerm to throw IllegalArgumentException was n <= 0,
	getFibTerm(0) will throw exception. I fixed this bug when dealing with the
	failure of testThrowsIllegalArgumentException.
	
(c)	It fails because Fibonacci sequence should be adding instead of subtracting,
	and n == 2 should not be a base case.
	I fixed it by changing the condition of base case and adding the return value
	of recursive calls instead of subtracting.

Problem 7. 

a. Warm-Up: Creating a Ball: Ball.java
	Fixed a bug in constructor, assigning the parameter volume to this.volume
	In getVolume(), return this.volume instead of 0.
	
b. Using Pre-Defined Data Structures: BallContainer.java
	The second approaches of implementing getVolume() is better, since keeping
	track of the total volume every time it add or remove a ball only cause constant
	time slower than not keeping track of it for add() and remove(). Also, for the
	first approaches the runtime for getVolume() is O(n), while for the second 
	approaches it would be O(1).
